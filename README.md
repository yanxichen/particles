Particles Effect

This is a JavaScript project that allows you to display particle-like effects on a webpage. It mimics the floating movements of dust in the air by controlling speed by particles' size; the spinning movements that can be observed on dusts in sunlight is simulated by changing the shape of the particle. It also randomizes opacity at any given time which resembles the particles fading in and out of the light.
